# My Personal Website

Name
Personal website for Paul Donovan
Description
This website is to introduce my interestes and hobbies. It is a chance to practice my newly aquired HTML and CSS skills. 
Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.
Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.
Installation
The website is in HTML and CSS and is easily viewable via the web browser.
Usage
The links on the website open to another project I have worked on such as writing on Twitter.
Some links are installed for a show such as those in the Nav browser.
The page is largely static with no animations and all the information is found in the one page. 
Support
You can reach out for support at pdstyle@gmail.com.au
Roadmap
I may update this website in the future if I decide to use it for promoting my writing or other projects.
